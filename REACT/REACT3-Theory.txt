Redux Thunk : Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
              This is particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations in Redux, such as API calls or other side effects.

              or

               Redux Thunk acts as a middleware that will return you a function instead of an object while calling through the action creators.

useMemo : useMemo is a React hook used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the result of a function and returning
          the cached value when the inputs to the function remain the same. This is particularly useful for expensive computations or calculations
          that don't need to be repeated on every render.

useCallback : useCallback is a React hook used for memoizing functions. It memoizes a callback function and returns a memoized
              version of the function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization is particularly
              useful in scenarios where passing callbacks to child components can lead to unnecessary re-renders.

Axios intercepters : Axios interceptors are middleware functions that Axios provides for intercepting requests or responses
                     before they are handled by the application. They allow you to globally intercept and modify HTTP requests 
                     or responses, add custom headers, handle errors, and perform other actions. Axios interceptors are powerful
                     tools for managing and customizing HTTP communication in your application.
