Suspense : Suspense is a feature in React that allows you to declaratively specify the loading
           states for components that are waiting for asynchronous data.

Profiler : The Profiler is a component in React designed to help developers measure the performance of their application. 
           It collects timing information about each render of a React component, allowing you to identify performance 
           bottlenecks and optimize rendering efficiency.
