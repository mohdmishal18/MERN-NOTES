 Topology : topology refers to the way in which data elements are organized and connected to each other. 
            It describes the structure and relationships among various elements in a data structure, 
            which can influence the efficiency and performance of data operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search.

splay Tree : Splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree data structure, which means that the tree structure is adjusted
             dynamically based on the accessed or inserted elements. In other words, the tree automatically reorganizes itself
             so that frequently accessed or inserted elements become closer to the root node.

adjecancy : adjacency refers to the relationship between vertices (or nodes) in a graph. 
            Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected directly by an edge.

dijkstra’s algorithm : Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph,
                       which can either be directed or undirected.

CRLF (\r\n) is a line ending convention used primarily by Windows and certain network protocols to denote the end of a line. 
Proper handling of CRLF is crucial for compatibility across different systems and adherence to protocol specifications.
