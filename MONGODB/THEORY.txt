⚙️Database Profiler : 🔗The database profiler collects detailed information about Database Commands executed against a running mongod instance. 
                       This includes CRUD operations as well as configuration and administration commands.
                       🔗The profiler writes all the data it collects to a system.profile collection, a capped collection in each profiled database.
                       See Database Profiler Output for an overview of the system.profile documents created by the profiler.
                       *the profiler is off by default.
